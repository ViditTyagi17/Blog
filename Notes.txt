// What is React Router?
// React Router is a library that allows navigation between different pages or components
// in a React app without reloading the page.
// It helps create a Single Page Application (SPA) experience where the page doesn’t refresh on route changes.


// createBrowserRouter
// Used to define the route structure of your app.
// You specify which path (like "/", "/about", "/login") should show which component.
// It returns a router object that is later passed to <RouterProvider>.


// RouterProvider
// <RouterProvider> gives routing context to your entire app.
// It connects the React app to the router created using createBrowserRouter.
// Without it, components like <Link>, <Outlet>, or useNavigate() will not work.


// Link
// <Link> is used for navigation between routes through the UI.
// It works like an <a> tag but does not reload the page, ensuring smooth transitions.


// useNavigate
// useNavigate() is a hook used to navigate between pages using JavaScript logic.
// Commonly used after login, logout, or form submission to redirect users.


// Outlet
// <Outlet> acts as a placeholder for rendering child routes inside a parent layout.
// It is used when you have nested routes (for example, showing pages inside a main layout).


// navItems
// navItems is an array of navigation links used to dynamically generate the navbar.
// It helps display different links depending on user state (like Login, Logout, Home, etc.).


// Flow Summary
// 1. Define routes using createBrowserRouter.
// 2. Connect router to the app using <RouterProvider>.
// 3. Use <Link> for navigation through the UI.
// 4. Use useNavigate() for navigation using JavaScript logic.
// 5. Use <Outlet> to render child routes inside a layout.
// 6. Use navItems to create dynamic navigation menus.
